Development TODOs:
- Extend logger for the regulator	
	* Queue levels
	* Updates from central - with time (non-regular?)
	* Internal events? Every time a client connects, along with the number of retries
- Analyze and solve asynchronous update of server values on regulator
- Investigate why, and when we get Connection timed out: no further information
- Add support for choosing algorithm when starting regulator
- Remove comments like "PUT http://192.168.5.68:8081/regulator/update?numberOfAcceptedJobs=1373 responded with 204 No Content in 0ms" Redundant and steals IO
- Fix log file
- Is our log API efficient enough?

Other TODOs:
- Theory behind TCP
	* How long should our backlong be?
	* How long can clients survive in queue? How can we affect this?
- TCP termination? Does this affect anything on the server?
